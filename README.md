## 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Timur Schmidt**, a curious and motivated programmer currently studying at [42Heilbronn](https://42heilbronn.de/). I enjoy exploring everything from low-level systems programming to machine learning workflows and a bit of cybersecurity along the way.

## 🧭 About Me

At 42, I've had the chance to build everything from C-based command-line tools to automated ML pipelines. I’m especially interested in how things work under the hood — whether that’s in memory management, data workflows, or infrastructure.

- 📚 Still learning — and always trying to understand the "why" behind the tools  
- 🛠️ Enjoy practical projects that bring theory to life  
- 🔐 Took part in *Cybersecurity Day Heilbronn* and our team secured first place 🥇
